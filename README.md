# Full Stack Open — Part 3: Phonebook Backend

This repository contains my implementation of **Part 3** of the University of Helsinki’s **Full Stack Open** course.  
Part 3 focuses on building and deploying a backend service using Node.js and Express, integrating it with a MongoDB database, and connecting it to the frontend Phonebook application.

This backend is deployed and publicly accessible.
